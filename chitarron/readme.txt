FS Fender Telecaster Electric Guitar Distortion - FreePats version
------------------------------------------------------------------

Release 2016-11-03

This soundfont is assembled by roberto@zenvoid.org for the FreePats project,
using sound samples from the "FS Fender Telecaster Electric Guitar Bridge
Pickup Direct In" by FlameStudios:
http://www.flamestudios.org/free/GigaSamples

Contains a small subset of samples from the original GIG file. Samples had
been greatly modified and processed trough Guitarix virtual amplifier to
create a distorted guitar sound. There are other versions of this soundfont
in the FreePats web site: http://freepats.zenvoid.org/

I want to thank Gary from FlameStudios for answering to my email and giving
permission to distribute his samples under the FreePats GPL special exception.
